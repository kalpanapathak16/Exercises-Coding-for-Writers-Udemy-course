# Exercises: Coding for Writers Udemy course
This repository contains exercises I tackled during my enrollment in the Udemy course, **Coding for Writers: Basic Programming**. I used the *Notepad++* text editor for writing the code, and then saved the files with the *.html* format. 
## Exercises
1. **Hello World**: Created a “Hello World” web page using HTML and JavaScript. See *helloworld.html*.
   
   * **HTML**: The HTML creates a web page with the paragraph “Hello World Example”.
   * **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code creates a pop-up window that says, “Hello, World!”.
2. **Strings**: Modified the “Hello, World!” string to be two strings using **concatenation**. See *helloworld-string.html*.
3. **JavaScript and HTML**:
   * Built a web page that has a text box for first and last names. After clicking the **Click me** button, it displays the full name. See *JavaScriptAndHtml.html*. 
   * Added a second button that says “Last Name First”. After clicking it, it calls a new function that replaces the fullName paragraph with the last name, a comma, and then the first name. See *JavaScriptAndHtml-second-button.html*.
4. **Documenting constants**: Documented constants declared in the code. See *Documenting constants.md*.
5. **Operators**: Created HTML and JavaScript that uses the following binary number operators:
   * **+** Adds two numbers. See *Operators-addition*.html.
   * **-** Substracts two numbers. See *Operators-substraction.html*.
   * _*_ Multiplies two numbers. See *Operators-multiplication.html*.
   * **/** Divides two numbers. See *Operators-division.html*.
   * **%** (Mod operator) Divides two numbers and takes the remainder. See *Operators-mod-operation.html*.
   * **+** and **/** Add the two numbers together and divide it by 2. See *Operators-average-of-two-numbers.html*.
6. **Functions**: Created JavaScript functions and compared local and global variables.
   * **Change Size of Textbox**: Created a program that changes the width of a text box using a function called **setWidth**. See *Functions-change-size-of-the-textbox.html*.
   * **Average two numbers**: Created a function to average two numbers. See *Functions-average-two-numbers.html*.
   * **Length of a name**: Wrote a function to calculate the length of a full name, and then added a button when clicked, it displays the full length. See *Functions-length-of-a-name.html*.
