# Exercises: Coding for Writers Udemy course
This repository contains exercises I tackled during my enrollment in the Udemy course, **Coding for Writers: Basic Programming**. I used the *Notepad++* text editor for writing the code, and then saved the files with the *.html* format. 
## Exercises
1. **Hello World**: Created a “Hello World” web page using HTML and JavaScript. See *helloworld.html*.
   
   * **HTML**: The HTML creates a web page with the paragraph “Hello World Example”.
   * **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code creates a pop-up window that says, “Hello, World!”.
2. **Strings**: Modified the “Hello, World!” string to be two strings using **concatenation**. See *helloworld-string.html*.
3. **JavaScript and HTML**:
   * Built a web page that has a text box for first and last names. After clicking the **Click me** button, it displays the full name. See *JavaScriptAndHtml.html*. 
   * Added a second button that says “Last Name First”. After clicking it, it calls a new function that replaces the fullName paragraph with the last name, a comma, and then the first name. See *JavaScriptAndHtml-second-button.html*.
4. **Documenting constants**: Documented constants declared in the code (to control a little robotic ball). See *Documenting-constants.md*.
